# Odin Flight Booker

Made in response of one of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) [assignments](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms).

Assignment description:

> We’ll be creating a one-way flight booker.
> You’ll get lots of practice populating and
> building dropdown menus, radio buttons, and
> nested submissions. Let the fun begin!

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repository and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
