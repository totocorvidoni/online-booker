Made in response of one of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) [assignments](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms?ref=lnav).

Assignment description:

> In this project, you’ll get a chance to tackle
> some more advanced forms. This is the kind of
> thing you’ll have to work with when handling
> user orders for anything more complicated than
> an e-book. In this case, we’ll build the first
> three steps of a typical checkout process for
> booking a one-way flight.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repository and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
